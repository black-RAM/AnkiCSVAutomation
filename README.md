# AnkiCSV
## Idea
The idea was for this to be a script that takes in a CSV file as input then automatically creates flashcards in the Anki desktop app using the CSV's data.

## Problem
But, I ran into issues trying to get the path to Anki executable (because it's a Universal Windows App, my laptop denies me permission). And I could not take the alternative route of accessing package information because apparently the creators did not include it? (In the app's README.md, it says you have to add this yourself to the app's "solution" before you can build the source code.)

## Resolution
I quit, for now. 

But, hopefully, I will come back one day and make this work.

And after I make this work, I may even work on [my own fork](https://github.com/black-RAM/Anki-Universal-CSV) of the Anki app to make the app work with CSV files instead of the custom `Anki Desktop Package` file type.
